TODO

- use ephemerides for moon/earth? (low priority)
- add play/pause/restart UI and functionality
- fork camera and fix it
- implement simple radar sensor truth side
- implement radar sensor on embedded side
- port the landing algo from orbiter to this demo
- update FSW to no longer use chrono::time, but time provided by something (which is then populated from the simulation)
